## Profile
My name is Peter. I am 25 years old and currently employed as Data Scientist at the international consumer lending company, 4finance.
I am a highly self-driven individual with a flair and interest for advanced analytics. Until now, my approach has mostly been statistical,
although I have recently become more acquainted with Machine Learning methodologies, which I intend to explore further. In addition, I have started to dive a bit into software programming as well.<br/>
Apart from my professional profile, I am into playing music, gaming, running and spending time with friends, colleagues and family.
